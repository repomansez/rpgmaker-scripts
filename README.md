# Why write these if there's already rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs?

Three reasons:
- These scripts are way smaller and adhere to the UNIX philosophy of keeping it simple
- These scripts were first written with packaging Mudbeu's games for native Linux in mind, with a simple launch script to allow users to run the game without downloading third party software, making it easier for non tech-savvy players
- I felt like doing it

# Warning about NWJS

RPGMaker is for some reason VERY sensitive to different nwjs versions, sometimes even one subversion can be the difference between a game working or not even launching, so if you're having problems, try to experiment with different NW.js versions.

RPGMaker MZ is newer so it's known to work better with newer NW.js versions, while RPGMaker MV usually breaks on anything over version 0.59.1.
