# Why write these if there's already rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs?

Three reasons:
- These scripts are way smaller and adhere to the UNIX philosophy of keeping it simple
- These scripts were first written with packaging Mudbeu's games for native Linux in mind, with a simple launch script to allow users to run the game without downloading third party software, making it easier for non tech-savvy players
- I felt like doing it
